### 2. **Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason**

- While he was talking about encouraging the people of the Philippines to become more physically active, he listed several Filipino athletes that serve as inspritation to the Filipino people. One of the people he stated was PNP Cheif Nicolas Torre because of his recent boxing match with Sebatian Duterte. 

> I found it weird at first why he was mentioning a PNP chief, but when I found out the meaning behind it i found it funny.

- Promising that even people who are powerful or rich are not exempted from the laws of our country.

> I found it weird because, in my opinion, I have doubts with this statement since there are stil several courrupt officials in our country. However, I do trust that they are trying to fulfill this promise.



### 3. **Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)**

I found the this years SONA from President Ferdinand Marcos very interesting overall. This is my first time listening to a SONA and this gave me hope for our country. A lot of promises were made and were fulfilled to an extent, which is a great thing to hear. I am glad to hear that unfortunate people of our country are given the help they need, which I found really inspiring. Listening to this SONA makes me inclined to help others in any way I can.

I am really proud of all the forward growth we are having, as a country. Yes there are sitll problems that need to be solved like courruption, poverty, our economy, and many more. However, this SONA has given me hope that our country will be able to overcome these challenges as one. As I have stated earlier, I now want to grow up and help not just my country, but the whole world through studying in Pisay and to contribute to our understanding of science.
