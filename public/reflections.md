# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.

### 1. **Basic JavaScript Syntax**
* This is the topic I understand the most. All java script code should be placed inside the script element and the script should be inside the body section of the document. For the names of identifiers, we use camelCase. The variable myvariable is different from myVariable. A semicolon is not required at the end of a statement, but is advised to be included. 
### 2. **Kinds of Variable Declerations**
* Values of variables are assigned by using the equals sign. To declare a variable, we use var, let, and const. Var is used to create and declare a variable and it is possible to reassign the value of the variable, but is rarely used by programmers. Let is similar to var but it is not possible to redefine the variable and will give you SyntaxError if you try to do so. Const creates a constant whose scope is either global or local to the declared block which we declare it to. 
### 3. **If-Else Statements**
* If-else statements are a type of conditional statement in javascript. It is used to execute or display different commands for varying conditions of a variable. It is located inside a function and its structure starts with an if, then the condition in parentheses, then the command to be excecuted in curly brackets. To excecute the next condition we use else if and else for anything that wasn't defined in the other conditions. It is commonly used in relation with comparison and logical operators.
### 4. **Comparison and Logical Operators**
* Comparison operators use two or three equals signs, instead of using a single equal sign which is used to assign a value. Two are used to only check the value, while three are used to check value and type of variable. Logical operators are used to compare two different values and return a boolean value but may also return a non-boolean value when used with non-boolean values. Logical and is used to return true only if both operands are true, while logical or is used to returnn true when atleast one of the operands are true.
### 5. **Output and Input Statements**
* Output statements are used to display information to the user, while input statements are used to accept information from the user. The output statements are console.log, alert, document.write, and document.getElementById(id).innerHTML. Console.log is used to output code into the console and is used to debug the code, alert is used to pop out a box on the users browser with the value to be shown, document.write to write the output directly on the browser but it may overwrite the text already on the browser, and document.getElementById(id).innerHTML to display you output using an HTML element. To get input we use the prompt and confirm box, promt to accept typed information from the user and confirm to check or approve something from the user.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.
### 1. **Compound Assignment Operators**
* Unlike assignment operators, these do an arithmetic operation before assigning the value to the variable. Examples of these are addition asiignment and subtraction assignment. I understand the description of it. However, sometimes I get confused doing these especially when I am analyzing code. 
### 2. **Not Equal To Comparison Operators**
* These comparison operators basically negate the boolean value. For instance, the result of the comparison is true, it will be turned into false. Again, I understand the concept but I need to practice the application of these and analyzing these in a block of code.
### 3. **Modulo Operators**
* Modulo operators are just basic division, but instead of the answer of the division operation they output the remainder of the operation. I often get confused on what is the output, the decimals that follow the answer of the division operation or the remainder during long division. 
### 4. **Switch Case Statement**
* Switch case statements work by evaluating the expression stated and compares it to the value of the different cases stated below. It is not about the concept of this statement that challenges me. Instead, it is the application of this. I am more comfortable in using the if else statement, and ofthen when I use switch case I get mistakes in the syntax and forget the needed break statement.
### 5. **For Loops** 
* For loops is control statement that executes a block of code for a specific amount of times until a certain condition is reached. For me, I find the syntax a bit confusing to look at and analyze. Similar to previous stated topics, I also get confused in the syntax. 

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
### I plan to further practice writing code which incorperate the topics that I find challenging. This is to practice writing the format and to understand further how these work, for when I am assigned a task to include these topics I can accomplish these with ease.

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
### **Effective**
* The activity where you have to be the first one to create code that the teacher is asking for. This helped me think and remember the topic we have discussed more since I immeadietly apply it. 
* The activities where we input the code in VPL were also helpful for me. Through this we can immeadietly check if our code is working and check the errors in our code and debug it.
### **Not Effective**
* The kahoot activities that were linked with the topics that were discussed during CS2 didn't really help me understand since this is my first year here in PSHS. 
* The markdown activities didn't help me in understanding the topics in out course since these aren't really connected to it. However, it is good to know about how to use markdown.
